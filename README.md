# Number-Guessing-Game
## Description
This is a simple CLI based number guessing game made with python.

At first, I will think a number between 1 and 100. You have to guess the number within a given number chances.

If you guessed the right number before you run out of chances, you win. Otherwise after each chance, if you guessed a number less than what I thought, then I will say 'too low'. Or if it is greater than what I thought, I will say 'too high'. If you run out of chances without guessing the right number, you lose.

## Note
- If you are running the program in a Windows computer, then change the line `os.system("clear")` to `os.system("cls")` in the program.
